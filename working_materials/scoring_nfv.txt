Networking - trunk ports
------------------------

networking-trunk-port-crud:          [1,0,1] [1,1,1] [1,1,0] [0,1,1] [1] [76]*
networking-trunk-subport-crud:       [1,0,1] [1,1,1] [1,1,0] [0,1,1] [1] [76]*
networking-trunk-show-trunk-details: [1,0,1] [1,1,1] [1,1,0] [0,1,1] [1] [76]*

Notes:
  * In line with established practice in the main programs, typical sets of
    operations have been combined into CRUD groups:
    * network-trunk-port-crud
       * networking-trunk-port-create
       * networking-trunk-port-list
       * networking-trunk-port-update
       * networking-trunk-port-show
       * networking-trunk-port-delete
    * network-trunk-subport-crud
       * networking-trunk-add-subport
       * networking-trunk-delete-subport
       * networking-trunk-list-subport
  * I scored the 'widely deployed' criterion with 1 in the context of NFV
    deployments. Since these deployments are typically private clouds, it is
    hard to determine actual availability.
  * The 'discoverable' capability has been scored with a 1 despite a peculiar
    corner case. In general, the trunk port feature is discoverable as part of
    the regular Neutron extension discovery mechanism. However, there exists a
    corner case, which is created by a specific order of API calls. Whether or
    not the API calls in this specific order succeed is backend dependent, but
    this backend capability is not discoverable.
    Details:
    - Documented order of API calls which always succeed
        i) create Neutron port
       ii) convert port to a trunk port
      iii) boot VM with trunk port
    - Order of API calls with backend-dependent success
        i) create Neutron port
       ii) boot VM with Neutron port
      iii) convert Neutron port to trunk port
      In this order, the last step only succeeds on specific backends. Whether
      or not the backend in use supports this order of API calls is not
      discoverable.
    The official documentation describes a workflow corresponding to the first
    order of API calls. Hence, users of the trunk ports very likely only follow
    the recommended workflow, thereby not encountering the particular corner
    case.
  * vlan-transparent networks is related to VLAN trunk ports and equally
    important. There are no tempest tests for this feature, though.



BGP/MPLS VPNs - networking-bgpvpn
---------------------------------

networking-bgpvpn-bgpvpn-crud:          [1,1,1] [1,1,1] [1,1,0] [0,1,1] [0] [0]
networking-bgpvpn-net-assoc-crud:       [1,1,1] [1,1,1] [1,1,0] [0,1,1] [1] [82]*
networking-bgpvpn-router-assoc-crud:    [1,1,1] [1,1,1] [1,1,0] [0,1,1] [1] [82]*


Notes:
  * creating VPNs is an admin API. The non-admin API criterion should be relaxed
    for the NFV program
  * missing (non-negative) test cases for
    - list, show, delete VPNs
    - list, show networking associations
    - list, show router associations
  * consider using scenario tests as well



NFV-feature candidates for inclusion in first release:
------------------------------------------------------

  * Heat add-on
    - Heat is heavily used for orchestration purposes in the NFV context and 
      hence this add-on program is a good candidate for inclusion in the NFV
      vertical program.
    - This add-on program should be included once it has been approved.

  * EPA support (NUMA awareness, huge page support, CPU pinning)
    - no matching Tempest tests found (yet)
      - potential tests would set corresponding properties and verify that the
        properties have been applied
      - open question how to do the verification through Tempest as this might
        require checking things on the compute hosts

  * SR-IOV support
    - Using SR-IOV NICs for Neutron ports is mostly a deployment configuration
      issue and mostly transparent from an API perspective:
      - https://docs.openstack.org/mitaka/networking-guide/config-sriov.html
      - the only API-related parameter in this guide is "vnic_type"
    - No SR-IOV-specific Tempest tests found (yet)
    - Minimum scope for NFV vertical would be to include the SR-IOV agent in
      the list of designated sections

  * (subset of) telemetry services
    - this needs to be defined further



NFV-feature candidates for inclusion in later releases:
-------------------------------------------------------
  * Designate add-on
    - DNS service not used in NFV context

  * heat-translator project

  * Nova placement API

  * multi-queue support
    - multi-queue support important for performance but current implementation
      not usable by legacy VNFs

  * support for dynamic queue size configuration
    - under development

  * Neutron SFC
    - no industry alignment yet between IETF model and Neutron SFC model 

  * LBaaS
    - legacy VNFs typically perform internal load-balancing and do not rely on
      infrastructure services

  * Neutron FWaaS
    - VNFs use multiple networks: the majority are VNF-internal networks which
      are isolated by design. External networks are typically isolated within
      operator network. Shared network use cases which require firewalling
      not very common.

  * Pysical function pass-through
    - complementary to SR-IOV, under development

  * QoS

  * bandwidth-based scheduling

  * Tacker as orchestration tool

  * Masakari (VM HA)
    - relatively new project, not yet widely deployed

  * tap-as-a-service

  * DPDK dataplane support

  * hardware acceleration (SmartNICs)
